Haskell Android Example
=======================

This is a native haskell program example on android.

We use GHC 8.0.1 and Android NDK r9b.

Build uses gradle and cabal. This can be built best with nix package manager using [nix-build-ghc-android] (http://github.com/wavewave/nix-build-ghc-android). To build this, in `hs` directory, run

    > ./build.sh
